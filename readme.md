A postfix, or Reverse Polish Notation (RPN), calculator is a neat little program to write.  You can do it simply, using
a working stack to process a given expression as you enumerate its tokens, or you can be more esoteric - just for the
hell of it.  This repo contains an example of such an esoteric implementation using OO/polymorphism.  Hey, sometimes you
just gotta have fun.
